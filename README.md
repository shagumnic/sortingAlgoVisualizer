# sortingAlgoVisualizer
A sorting algorithms visualizer using tkinter in Python:
- Generate random bar charts (max 25), each has length varies based on the value of the bar (the value of the bar is randomized from between the min value and the max value based on player choice.
- Implement famous algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and use them to sort the chart.
- Visualize the working proccess of each algorithm selected on the screen (user could adjust the speed based on their preference (from 0,2s to 2s) to watch it slower or faster).
- Once it has all sorted, turn all the bar color from red to green.

# Things to do :
- Improve the visualization proccess for Heap Sort (the algorithm already works).
- Changing from randomly generate random numbers to randomly pick the games from the video games list that was supplied before hand and sorted them based on review score.

# Tool use:
- Python
- tkinter
- random library
- time library
- pyinstaller convert it into an .exe file
